                Agumon is a Reptile Digimon. It has grown up and become able to walk on two legs, and has an appearance like a tiny dinosaur. Because it is still on the way to adulthood, its power is low, but as its personality is quite ferocious, it doesn't understand fear. It has grown hard, sharp claws on both its hands and feet, and demonstrates its power in battle. It is also a being that foretells Digivolution to a great and powerful Digimon.

DeckerGreymon's comprehensive combat strength is equivalent to that of a battalion composed of 324 combat-model Digimon, so even if a hypothetical group of enemies tried to lie in wait for it, with its great firepower and tenacious defensive power, and its ability to cover ground without trouble from any kind of rough terrain, it will trample the enemy line in a violent assault. It's worth mentioning that it can \"use multiple Special Moves against multiple opponents\", and thanks to this ability, DeckerGreymon can fight against an army corps even on its own. Also, the energy that is enhanced within its body to its utmost limit grants DeckerGreymon a final bold move. Even if you are able to take DeckerGreymon down, it isn't finished.

It masks the sounds it makes along with its appearance, and is capable of infiltrating or causing a disturbance without being noticed, even when manoeuvring at high speeds. Thanks to the VR Goggles on its brow, the target's movements after a few seconds are predictively displayed, allowing it to act with precision. It has prepared techniques suited for reconnaissance-in-force. Also, it is rumored to be used by the Crack Team for intelligence operations in various locations.",

While its appearance is so beautiful that it enraptures all who lay eyes upon it, the stench it emits is out of this world. There are a number of people who fell for Rafflesimon's beauty at first sight and sought to find it again after a single glance. However, Rafflesimon's lifespan is short, and its life processes will cease after just several days have passed. Because of the extremely low likelihood of being able to catch sight of a Rafflesimon, it is also known as the \"Miraculous Flower\". Despite its circumstances, Rafflesimon never expresses any pessimism about its looming death, constantly yearning to live a normal life and dancing elegantly till its very last. It utilizes the large flower petals that dance around it as reflectors, reflecting its shots so that no enemy can escape.",

Its main body, formed from the fusion of the Digicores at a higher plane, was made in the image of \"the knight that would wield them\" as imagined by Durandamon and Bryweludramon. While RagnaLoardmon is a DNA Digivolution form, it is unusual in that it still retains Durandamon and Bryweludramon's consciousnesses, while the main body itself has its own, separate consciousness. The sword and shield hover and move out of their own wills without coming into direct contact with RagnaLoardmon; they make sport of the enemy with the way they enact their offensive and defensive maneuvers like three separate beings in one body. Their level of coordination is stunning, giving rise to its absolute defense and sudden and unpredictable, yet powerful attacks, which are nigh impossible to overcome.",

On one hand, it seems ferocious, but on the other, it is said to love music and songs, and it likes to hum songs with natural soundingbackground musiclike the sound of the wind, raindrops, the murmuring of a river, or the stirring of leaves on a tree. Because it can often become too enthusiastic in its song, accidentally letting off its \"Bellow Blaster\" (Soul Crusher) even though there aren't any enemies, it's probably safest to leave the spot at once if Shoutmon starts singing, so that it doesn't notice you.

There is definitely a strict hierarchy, and the complex maneuvers that are demanded by Starmon are demonstrated by the Pickmon, such as the corps techniques named \"Meteor Squall\" and \"Wish Upon A Star\". As Starmon has a cheerful, showy personality, it is an extreme optimist. Basically, it never gets depressed, and if it even seems depressed it seems to only be thinking things like, \"I may be down, but don't I look good?\" Because of that, even though it is taken lightly by other Digimon, it certainly doesn't worry about itself at all.",
