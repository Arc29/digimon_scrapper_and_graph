It is a mysterious Digimon that digivolved enormously by absorbing the negative data that the Network is overflowing with beyond its limit. Its raison d'\u00eatre is to transcend good and evil, and return everything to nothingness. It bites into Digimon and the Digital World itself with the large mouth at its center and the mouths on its numerous tentacles, and after doing so, only the blank data of empty space is left behind. The birth of Abbadomon is undoubtedly a crisis for all Digital Worlds, so it is conjectured that some Digital Worlds from other dimensions have been annihilated by it. You will be erased the instant you suffer any of Abbadomon attacks.",

Because it is based on the Plant-tribe, its weight is especially light compared to the other forms. It is able to fire sturdy thorns from the Busters equipped to both of its arms, and perform tricky movements that hook its thorns in various places similar to Rope Action, or perform others that are used for offense and defense. Its keen movements which capitalize on its equipment and agility can definitely be said to be this form's greatest distinction.",

It is an incarnation of the \"Firewall\" that defends the Net, and is a guardian deity. Because of its easily fired-up personality, it has a soldier-like aspect that practices mental training with yoga exercises, and its way of speaking is somewhat archaic, like a kenpo artist. In battle, it fights by freely using Oriental martial arts, and accumulates flames at one point of its body with a trick that focuses its spirit, to raise its offensive ability. It wields the flame-clad Burning Wrist battle gloves.",

In battle, it unleashes super-wide ranged attacks that melt everything then burn it up without a trace. This aspect has enough destructive power, in that moment, to bear a close resemblance to the menace of modern nuclear weapons.

As each test confirmed that the Digivolution would result in this DIgimon, researches theorize that, under suitable conditions, Arcturusmon could actually manifest in the Digital World. While its mannerisms and behavior are unknown, the amount of dark energy measured in the simulations far surpasses that of all identified Digimon, which indicates that the emergence of Arcturusmon could hypothetically results in a Digital Hazard that would reshape the face of the Digital World.",

In addition to its large wings, which have increased its flying ability, and the gigantic Tail Anchor, which has been honed to its sharpest, it is a form characterized by its right arm, thought to be that of Bagramon, which bestowed mighty destructive power upon Arresterdramon. Usually, the Kinkoji has the role of inhibiting its power, but it appears to have the opposite role of granting it power, and is said to be proof that Arresterdramon Superior Mode is recognized as a Digimon that uses its power for righteousness. With this drastically increased power, it fights against fiendish Digimon.",

AxeKnightmon, who brings the older brother's ingenuity together with the younger brother's mobility, has become a first-class warrior. The skills of AxeKnightmon, who can use the \"Twin Spear\" it wields to thrust, slash, sweep, or throw as the situation calls for, are very advanced, and it is said there are few people powerful enough to fight AxeKnightmon fairly to its face and defeat it. While AxeKnightmon possesses that much competency, it will use any means to achieve its goals and won't hesitate to get its hands dirty, and sometimes it will even be willing to betray its own comrades. AxeKnightmon, who is furnished to an implacable depth with merit, is an opponent that you don't want to turn into an enemy, if you can help it.",

It shows off lightning-speed movements fast enough that they earned it the alias of \"Running Lightning\", and its top speed is so fast that you can see afterimages. However, fine maneuvers are its weak point, so its linear movements can be easily read by its opponent, and it easily collides with obstacles.

Although Baalmon will answer any kind of question, it always inflicts an ordeal for the answer. If that ordeal is not surmounted, then it will not give the requested answer, and will snatch away your soul. Its mantle is covered in amulets from all times and places, and it is said that on those amulets are written solutions for every problem, so that with that wealth of information it is able to completely defend against any attack. It holds the \"D\u01cesh\u00e9nbi\u0101n\" (\u6253\u795e\u97ad lit. \"Spiritual Whip\") in its hands.",

Although it was originally a high-ranking Angel Digimon that ruled over death, it despaired against the unreasonable justice of the world and rebelled against God. It then received the scourge of God and eternally lost one of its eyes and half of its body, and has since replaced that half with an artificial body cut from King Drasil. Its long, artificial right arm can catch hold of ghostly forms, and the large ruby that it replaced its lost eye with allows it to observe anywhere within the Digital World. Due to these, Bagramon is known across the Digital World as the \"Sage of Death\". Although Bagramon's sins will be forgiven if it repented before God, it will not go back to submission under God. This is because it still seeks to replace the \"Unreasonable Justice of the World\" that God constructed, and its goal in life is to banish God from the world with its \"New Justice\".",

        "description": "Ballistamonis a Machine Digimon. It is a heavyweight Digimon that possesses bulky metallic armor and overwhelming power. It appears warlike at first glance, but because of its gentle personality, preferring harmony to conflict, it will never attack first. However, if it gets into a fight, it becomes a powerful and matchless fighter that swings its stout arms and wipes out the opponent. With its heavy armor and great power, its potential for both offense and defense is great, and if it connects with a hit then it doesn't quit, although its specialty is a one-hit knockout attack which capitalizes on its great power. However, its too-heavy body can be its ruin and there is a problem with its keenness, so it is not very good at fighting with fast-moving opponents. The horn on its head is its pride, and though the horn becomes the essence of its close-combat attacks, it hates for the horn to be carelessly touched. Also, Ballistamon is able to lend its heavy armor and power to another Digimon by changing into its \"Enhanced-armor Mode\"(\u5f37\u5316\u88c5\u7532\u5f62\u614b,Kyoukasoukou Keitai).",

It similarly extends a hand to those Digimon who feel ill at ease with and isolated from the world, and from living together, they have formed a group called the \"Mamemon Gang (\u8c46\u9580\u9023\u5408, Mame-mon Reng\u014d, lit. \"Mame-mon Union\")\". However, continuing to betray the rules of the world is not an easy task for them, and although BanchoMamemon has had to fight those Digimon who aim to usurp it as leader under the pretense of a rebirth of the group several times over, the collective power of the \"Mamemon Gang\" has made those usurpers withdraw. It is thought that it acquired the title of Bancho from being able to avoid enemies without losing its own family as well in all kinds of predicaments. As with BanchoLeomon, it wears a GAKU-RAN\" that negates the impact of physical attacks, and this defensive effect is often used to protect its companions.",

Its language is trollish, but it additionally conveys excess warmth. In battle, its underwater mobility is weak due to the nature of its wrestler-like style.",

While appearance-wise, it seems to be made from Red Digizoid, the true extent of its hardness cannot be analysed. Bryweludramon has two standalone AI units, Gause and Fay, which allow it to see in all directions. Gause and Fay also possess barriers made from flames, and are able to extend the scope of their barriers to cover even Bryweludramon. Because Gause and Fay are capable of acting independently of Bryweludramon, no matter how far-separated they are, it is said that they are even capable of covering the entire world with their barriers. Although Bryweludramon may be the strongest shield, it seems that its barriers have been broken and bested before by its nemesis Durandamon. However, transformation is the most valuable asset of a Legend-Arms; should one wield Bryweludramon while it is transformed into a shield, no enemy would be willing to keep up their assault.",

When it comes to the point where it is unable to win a match by attacking and defending with its tentacles, its body retracts into its mantle and it performs a powered up attack with its giant squid figure. The flexibility of its mantle is superior to its tentacles, so external physical attacks are ineffective.

Although they may look like large rabbit-ears, it has not ears, but a kind of sense organ with which it can sense the approach of other Digimon in no time. Thanks to this, it is extremely rare to catch sight of Cutemon, because it will immediately hide itself. If you do happen to catch sight of one, it is either a rare fortune, or Cutemon is mischievously luring you into a trap. Its trademark muffler is beyond imagination with its insulating properties, as it is very warm. If you are able to obtain one, you can call yourself lucky. It has the ability to heal wounds, and if it's in the vicinity of an injured Digimon, it will come closer, taking care not to be noticed, and heal that Digimon. Its scratches and cuts are already healed before it realizes what's going on, due to Cutemon's cute and mischievous nature.",

DeckerGreymon's comprehensive combat strength is equivalent to that of a battalion composed of 324 combat-model Digimon, so even if a hypothetical group of enemies tried to lie in wait for it, with its great firepower and tenacious defensive power, and its ability to cover ground without trouble from any kind of rough terrain, it will trample the enemy line in a violent assault. It's worth mentioning that it can \"use multiple Special Moves against multiple opponents\", and thanks to this ability, DeckerGreymon can fight against an army corps even on its own. Also, the energy that is enhanced within its body to its utmost limit grants DeckerGreymon a final bold move. Even if you are able to take DeckerGreymon down, it isn't finished. The immense energy that is released all at once from DeckerGreymon's body becomes a tremendous shock wave that scorches the earth for 10\u00a0km in every direction.",

It exists to serve as a familiar for higher-class Demon Digimon like Devimon and Myotismon, but it is also said to be the one responsible for tempting Devimon, who was an angel-species Digimon, and luring it to the Dark Side. Its personality is the epitome of a Dark Side Digimon, so although its offensive ability and the like are not strong, it is cunning and makes mischief all over, but it seldom voluntarily takes part in anything like direct combat. When it absolutely must fight, it uses its Special Move \"Demi Dart\". It prefers the dark, and is often with a higher-level Digimon at all times, so it seems that it is seldom observed on its own.",

As its pride is quite high, it believes itself to be nobility, but it considers the fact that it cannot fly to be mortifying. However, even though this Digimon has only digivolved to an Ultimate, its combat ability is possessed of high merit. It boasts of the crown it wears on its head, and its beak that shines gold.",

Its personality is the epitome of wickedness, and it is unmoved by a spirit of compassion. If it glares at them with its four eyes burning in deep crimson, the opponent becomes unable to move, and it will chop up their unresisting body. Also, the tip of its tail is able to open up and take on the shape of a claw, which can skewer the opponent.

The thought routines within its Digicore have run wild due to it taking in the X-Antibody, and it repeatedly destroys cyberspace in order to prove its own belief that it is an all-knowing, omnipotent God. It uses any means necessary to achieve its goals, and has learned the art of setting cruel and cunning traps and moving about so that it can always gain the upper hand. It shows up in front of the enemy with an appearance like that of a balancing toy, using its tail as a pivot point, and gives off a feeling of instinctive revulsion through its strange movements and the attacks it unleashes from normally impossible poses like a mollusk.",

It is the \"Manly-soul Mode\" (\u6f22\u9b42\u5f62\u614b, Kankon Keitai) which possesses a furious soul brought forth by the burning fighting spirit of Shoutmon and Dondokomon. As its rhythmically swung-down Stick strikes its opponents, the shriek of the percussion across the battlefield resounds. Generally speaking, as a Digimon burning hot, its irrepressible fighting spirit will make DonShoutmon rush even into conflicts it's not a part of, worsening the situation by leaps and bounds. If there's a petty quarrel in the west, it goes and starts a fist-fighting rumble, and if there's a trivial dispute in the east, it goes and starts a feud of wounds. Wherever DonShoutmon is, the conflicts will not be settled. The second that it abruptly dives into someone else's fight, discussion is useless and the opponent, with its Stick, it beats. Next, a different opponent, with its Stick, it beats. The first one, it beats. The next again, it beats. Then a third, it beats. Despite pretending to beat, it beats. No matter how, it beats. With this beating and beating and beating, a rhythm will gradually be produced. Sometimes harshly and sometimes dolefully, DonShoutmon will battle while spinning a tune. Those are DonShoutmon's Special Moves. Although each of these techniques are the same, their names (song titles) seem to differ according to their rhythm.",

Although its personality is ferocious, Dracomon can show its gentle side only to the others it has recognized. It has wings, but it is unable to fly because they are not sufficiently developed. Also, it has a nature whose primary trait is wanting to collect \"shiny things\", with an especially strange attachment to gems and metals, and it eats and assimilates its favorite things. Amongst the scales that cover Dracomon's whole body, there is one scale that is called the \"Gekirin\"(\u9006\u9c57,\"Gekirin\").If it is touched there, Dracomon loses its mind to an excess of anger, and indiscriminately fires its \"Great Strike\".",

It is a Super Digimon that overwhelms other Digimon with its large build and extreme power, and that is able to travel at high speed, contrary to its appearance, due to the gigantic turbines on both of its ears. It can't fly through the sky using its turbines, but with their hovering function, it is capable of traveling even on water because it moves by slightly raising its body from the ground. Although its personality is very gentle, Elephantmon is a terrifying being as far as evil Digimon are concerned since it is a Digimon with a deep sense of justice.",

Though it belongs to the Royal Knights, it is simultaneously a being which stands at the top of all Dragon Digimon, and holds the alias of \"Dragon Emperor\". It possesses the gigantic, sentient wings \"Caledfwlch\" and the gigantic lance Ambrose (\"Ambrosius\"). The Caledfwlch is a unique set of wings composed entirely of Chrome Digizoid, and at its own will, it can at times change into wings for flight, or into a shield which defends Examon. The gigantic lance \"Ambrose\" is loaded with special shells stocked with viruses which possess various effects, so Examon's attacks are quite diverse.",

It always gets along with Plant Digimon like Palmon or Lillymon. Because the base is usually under construction, it has the duty of carrying home data left on fields of flowers or vegetation, little by little, to use as raw materials, causing it to be classified as a Virus-species. Also, because the base is defended by powerful Digimon, making it impossible to approach, the goal of that construction is a mystery at present. It's wisest to just run away when it uses its \"Hachi Hachi Call\".",

It makes a living by undertaking missions to eliminate targets. Fumamon not only makes great use of its physical prowess in close-combat, but also utilizes shuriken and other projectile weapons to remain a threat at mid and long-range, too. As Fumamon will doggedly chase down any target that flees, its prey's only hope of survival is to defeat Fumamon itself. Fumamon is able to manipulate the trajectory of Tsubakuro (\u71d5, Tsubakuro lit. \"Swallow\"), the shuriken attached to its gauntlets. It carries the ninja swords \"Shirasagi\" (\u767d\u9dfa, \"Shirasagi\" lit. \"White Heron\") and \"Kurosagi\" (\u9ed2\u9dfa, \"Kurosagi\" lit. \"Black Heron\") on its back.",

Since it specializes in running on land, it is totally incapable of swimming, as it dreads water. In fact, it can't even cross a 10\u00a0cm deep brook, and sometimes, you can run across a Gaossmon that has nearly drowned and passed out in a puddle of water.",

It has an extremely aggressive temperament despite its small size, and it never warms up to humans. Although the claws on its forelegs are very effective at attacking, they are also surprisingly suited to digging holes, which it always does as it enjoys watching other Digimon fall into its pitfalls due to its mischievous personality.",

Portions of its head and chest have transformed into new armor; its hardened wings have made it easier to move about during hand-to-hand combat, and also form pairs to act as a shield. Despite draining its holy power, its \"God Fist\", a fisticuff released from its hand, causes ordinary Mega Digimon to be blown away without getting struck, and it came to be known as the \"Sky-soaring, Strong-armed Fighting Dragon\".",

As a Digimon specializing in offensive power, its combat instinct is extremely high, and it possesses a cruel, brutal nature to not stop battling until it annihilates the opponent, so ordinary Digimon are not even able to approach it, as they are pushed back by the strange fighting spirit it gives off to its surroundings. It displays its especially tremendous fighting strength along with its sturdy flesh in close combat. Each of its techniques possesses immense destructive power, and furthermore, it can probably be said that it is almost impossible to hit Greymon in close combat because of its quick movements. Because it has a merciless personality whether or not one is a member of the same family, there is nothing but difficulty in using Greymon.",

Though Grizzlymon never starts fights, once someone makes it angry, it will stand up on its back legs and knock them down with its heavyweight forelegs, \"Bear Claws\" (\u718a\u722a, Kuma Tsume). With just this blow, most Digimon suffer a mortal wound as strong as the power they possess. These \"Bear Claws\" appear to have been imitated in WaruMonzaemon's \"Bear Claw\" equipment.",

It prefers to act alone since it hates being ordered about, however, its artisan pride is such that, once it recognizes someone's true merit, it will obediently abide them, and immerse itself in its own work. Although it's not very intelligent, its pride towards its work is intensely high and it has a strong tendency to take the opponent lightly. It also has a technique which creates Golemon using the earth around it and orders them to attack.",

With a brutal and insidious personality, it is a monster that chases after those who see it for days, and launches surprise attacks from behind every night. Despite its large build, it skilfully uses its spider legs to move quietly without making a sound. The bells hanging from the tips of its horns emit a sound only when it attacks, so those who have seen Gyuukimon will constantly be frightened by the sound of the bells. The dissonance produced by the bells deprives the opponent of their senses, making Gyuukimon's attacks advantageous.",

The source of its charging power is its passionate fighting spirit, and HeavyLeomon's strength doubles the more its fighting spirit burns. In addition, unlike its weapons, which are only used for fighting, it has a kind heart in that it also carries out rescue operations, so if there is a Digimon seeking help, it will firstly rush over to them, and then remove any obstacles using its prided power. While it is brimming with passionate fighting spirit, in battle, it walks about calmly analyzing the opponent. In different situations it steadily achieves victory with its tactics, which leave no openings regardless of whether it is short, medium or long-range combat.It produces flames from the lion on its chest.",

Its \"Divanish\" optical camouflage has also been updated. It masks the sounds it makes along with its appearance, and is capable of infiltrating or causing a disturbance without being noticed, even when manoeuvring at high speeds. Thanks to the VR Goggles on its brow, the target's movements after a few seconds are predictively displayed, allowing it to act with precision. It has prepared techniques suited for reconnaissance-in-force. Also, it is rumored to be used by the Crack Team for intelligence operations in various locations.",

It has a masterful sense of combat due to its lineage, and because of its training with its chaperones, the Sistermon sisters, it can more than hold its own in battle against its opponents even if they're an Ultimate.

It is a form of Imperialdramon Fighter Mode that acquired the power of the holy knight Omnimon, powering up and changing form into a legendary holy knight.

However, all of the details of that era are a mystery, and if research into Digimon and the Digital World progresses, it is likely that they will eventually be clarified.

It is said that rather than acting independently, it makes a coordinated response with nearby Digimon and the Sistermons, and its operation as a team relies on the others, which is rare even for the Royal Knights, because it doesn't have overconfidence in itself. Jesmon is the thirteenth Digimon considered suitable as a Royal Knight, tempered well by the frequent, rigorous trials of Gankoomon, who noticed the makings of one in the Rookie Digimon \"Hackmon\" it encountered. Because its \"Aus Generics\" leaves its physical abilities unbound by the laws of the Digital World, Jesmon can overpower any enemy without taking a single scratch.",

The details of how it digivolved into an insect Type are unclear, but it has both ant-like power and the flawless defensive ability possessed by a beetle. Its personality is the epitome of an insect's, and because it only possesses the instincts for survival, it has no intelligence or anything similar. It swoops down on hostile Virus Digimon without mercy. Its head has been metallized, and boasts the defense of an iron wall. Before Kunemon's discovery, Kabuterimon was thought to be the only existing Insectoid Digimon. There is a perfect rivalry between it and the Virus-attribute Kuwagamon, and there is only \"Conflict\" between them.",

It is snazzily dressed in its \"Monkey Suit\" (\u30b5\u30eb\u30b9\u30fc\u30c4, Saru S\u016btsu), engraved with the characters \"Great King\" (\u5927\u738b, Daiou) on its chest, but although it swaggers around with the affectation of a star, it only earns derision from other Digimon. Partnering with PrinceMamemon, it plays the part of a mock royal family of the Digital World. KingEtemon convinced PrinceMamemon it truly is a member of the royal family, and the embarrassing thing is that PrinceMamemon considers even the \"Royal Knights\" to be its subordinates.",

In addition, because it is a thoughtless person prone to making silly mistakes and jumping to the wrong conclusion, if it falls in love with its opponent then the misunderstanding will cause a ruckus. Because it has a confident personality but is naive in the ways of love, it strikes the opponent and sends them soaring if it's bashful, and strikes them dolefully if it's snubbed, so no matter how many lives the opponent it likes has, they aren't enough.

For that reason, its body became even larger, and its leg strength has developed tremendously, as well. Its wing portions have completely degenerated, and in battles, it spreads them wide along with its tail to intimidate the opponent. Its disposition is violently ferocious, but in order to preserve its large build, it avoids violent battles that consume its energy.",

It's closer to recklessness than dauntless courage, but in any case, it's a ruffian overflowing with desire and ambition. It's powerfully curious and a show-off, so it's pretty frivolous. On the brink of battle, it always pauses to offer a prayer to the god of ice and snow in which it believes, then shouts the names of its Special Moves and something humorous. However, in practice, it is being shrewd and is closely observing the opponent and terrain, heightening its advantage in combat.

Since it rarely acts of its own volition, it primarily operates in response to someone's requests or orders. It will have nothing to do if nobody is relying on it, and is likely to worry about its purpose in life and get completely depressed.

It has large wings that lift even its heavy body effortlessly into the air, and well-trained leg strength that allows it to stand imposingly. It dwells in the magma beds of active volcanoes around the Digital World, and it is theorized that it may live nearby Volcdramon. Its fighting style is scattering mineral dust, covering the enemy with it, and causing it to explode by freely manipulating its ignition point. If the enemy moves, it will result in ignition, so once they are covered in mineral dust, they will drown in terror when the dust explodes.",

Its mane has become a pneumatic drill, and it works primarily in tunnel construction and in the Chrome Digizoid mines. The Chrome Digizoid mines are often surrounded by a solid layer of bedrock, so it boasts both power and stamina, as well as top-class performance among Machine Digimon. There are many LoaderLiomon with a stubborn personality due to their pride in their work, but there are many people with the viewpoint that states, \"LoaderLiomon is just quarrelsome.\" It seems that one mine, which had the best deposits in the world, was blown away by a fight between LoaderLiomon.",

It is the possessor of a chivalrous spirit that puts its life on the line for the things it believes in, and hates injustice. Because Lobomon is taciturn and doesn't really like to concern itself with others, it often has the impression of being cold and unfeeling, but it is actually a kind-hearted warrior.

Although it was originally a Lion Digimon, it heaped modification upon modification and arrived at its current appearance. In the process, its consciousness vanished, and it became nothing more than a puppet that defeats those standing before it, as it is commanded. Because it doesn't act or think according to its natural instincts, it exhibits headlong assaults, heedless even of any traps or gadgets. Although it is fundamentally high-powered, its patterns are meager, with nothing but primitive attacks such as hitting and kicking. Nevertheless, caution is necessary, because its sharp claws bear a deadly poison which can cause anything to rot away.",

Also, its \"Charge Phantom\" chest armor, its long-range firing \"Sniper Phantom\" on its right arm, and its mid-range firing \"Strike Phantom\" on its left arm are capable of being detached, although this decreases a portion of its firepower. By spinning at high altitudes, the \"Laser Sights\" on its chest are capable of locking onto all anti-air and anti-ground targets, so as soon as it spins at an extremely high altitude and confirms its targets, it commences a full-scale attack.

        "description": "Magnamon X is a Holy Knight Digimon and a carrier of the X Antibody. The \"Chrome Digizoid\" grows stronger the more it is tempered, and there exists no other material quite like it. Magnamon's imaginary super-metal had become one with its limits, and was able to grow and regress as if it were made of muscles. The natural form of 'Chrome Digizoid' (in other words, the Digi-Egg of Miracles) was created using ancient technology, and its original characteristic was how it could be integrated into living organisms; a state similar to that, when combined with Magnamon's abilities, is thought to be the manifestation of a miraculous digivolution. When Magnamon's muscles, or 'Chrome Digizoid', are strained, they temporarily transform into \"Gold Digizoid\", which envelops its entire body in a golden glow; not only does it raise physical defense, it also bestows a state of absolute defense that is capable of resisting even data-disintegrating types of attacks. Furthermore, when in the \"Gold Digizoid\" state, its properties are similar to those of the Huanglong Ore, which boasts unparalleled, absolute hardness and is used as the base for 'Chrome Digizoid'; as such, in addition to absolute defense, it also adds a great amount of weight ill-suited for Digimon, though Magnamon has overcome that by tempering its own 'Chrome Digizoid'. One of the \"Royal Knights\", it digivolved through the power of the Digi-Egg of Miracles. During battle it will increase in hardness, and if it enters the \"Gold Digizoid\" state in which its entire body shines gold, it is completely invulnerable.",

It has a flat-structured build that is even more difficult to detect on enemy radar, and gained the ability to give off an emission that disrupts the enemy's sense of smell, barely making a sound as it moves. However, since its body is not invisible, the sharpness of its vision in detecting enemies ahead of it has improved, and it now takes action to avoid approaching enemies in advance. Due to these abilities, it is extremely difficult to capture Mantaraymon, even if it is nearby. However, only the light from both the \"Stun Needle\" and the electric bombs of its new Special Move \"Paralyze Bomb\" can be caught instantly.",

By uniting the dark knight and the fiendish demon lord it became the greatest emperor of evil. Its \"Imperium Vicious\", the evil power spilling out of its body, symbolizes that strength, and if a weak evil is bathed in it then it immediately becomes a grovelling subordinate. Even if you try to resist, it is considered difficult to maintain your sense of self if you are glared at by AxeKnightmon, who exists within its chest. According to one theory, it appears to be planning on destroying all good, in order to fill the world with evil and obtain a world that it can manipulate at will. Even though there are probably some Digimon whose strength is not outdone even by MegaDarknessBagramon itself, it is said that in order to designate its plan as something guaranteed, it expands its power by bringing useful Digimon under its control, and watches out for opportunities for the opposition. Even if the opponent seems to be keeping their distance, when it becomes aware of them it will attack them with its \"God of Death Snatcher\", one of its Digimon-manipulating techniques, and for opponents whose existence has no worth, it attacks them with its \"Eternal Darkmare\". The darkness held within the hearts ofhumansand Digimon is intensified and fused with MegaDarknessBagramon's own fathomless power.",

Although it will soften up to those who come bringing food, it will continue to lay low if they are an enemy. However, if the enemy refuses to leave its territory, it will engage them by displaying power that is unimaginable from its usual calm demeanor in order to protect its home.",

While its brilliant mind allows it to come up with various strategies, at the same time, it often ends up arguing with itself in a fast-paced soliloquy because of it. The powerful mirrors on both of its arms are referred to as the \"Irony no Tate\" (\u30a4\u30ed\u30cb\u30fc\u306e\u76fe, Iron\u012b no Tate, lit. \"Shield of Irony\"), and they reflect any damage dealt to it by the opponent's attacks back at the opponent.

However, because it is greedy and extremely fond of treasure, it charms those with its singing when it feels attracted to the treasure, even if their data (treasure) belongs to other Digimon, and then takes the opportunity to loot from them. For that reason, it is rumored that it hides a vast amount of data somewhere in the Net Ocean, but it loses interest in the data it has looted once it falls into its possession, and discards it.",

It then studied its own weaknesses from the data acquired through battling, and has now been perfectly reborn as an ultimate combat machine by full metallizing itself. Its body surface has a full coating of the Chrome Digizoid metal used by Metal-species Digimon. Its combat abilities have been raised to their maximum, giving birth to an invincible fighter which has acquired Strong- and Dirty-style wrestling skills.

        "description": "Mimicmon is a Mutant Digimon. It is a Champion Digimon thought to have mutated from security software used for protecting computer terminals. At first, it appears to be little more than a rusted, abandoned old cage, but when it senses the presences of a Virus Digimon, a black haze materializes within the cell and a long, ghastly arm stretches out from between the bars. As a result of capturing and taking in Virus-types that invade its territory similar to a trap, its own Attribute has become Virus as well. There are numerous Digimon sealed within its body, and the arms and horn coming out of its cage all originate from other Digimon. The weapon on its left arm \"Dead Shot\", its main equipment, is also loaded from the Digimon it has sealed, but its power has dropped dramatically due to the data being compressed.",

Even though it has shrunk in size, its monstrous strength has not weakened at all; it has instead grown able to run about nimbly while wielding its Olympia, despite Olympia being larger than it in size, and thus is even more of a headache to keep in check.",

It is a unique Digimon whose DigiCore is bare, so it seems it covers its DigiCore with Smoke in order to protect it, and has an unusual way of life. Because the Smoke was generated when its DigiCore was burned, it seems it is harmful neither to Mokumon itself nor to others. Also, because it is still in the middle of digivolving, when it encounters an opponent, it immediately flees. Then, it scatters the Smoke issuing from its body all around, and seizes the opportunity to escape when the opponent loses sight of it. As stated earlier, because it isn't particularly harmful, if you happen to see one, it would be best to be quiet.",

The shock wave when it fires is earth-shattering, and is enough that things sustain damage only by being in the surrounding area, even if they are not hit directly. After a bombardment at its maximum output, MusoKnightmon's power is set aside for forced cooling of the gun barrels, and it cannot fire rapidly. However, because it seems that there is no Digimon that can suffer this technique and remain safe, it can be said that there is no need for firing rapidly.",

While it loves alcohol and has an oppressive personality, ever since it invaded this Digital World (though the exact details regarding its invasion are unknown), it digivolved to become more active and turned into Nanimon. It trained and strengthened its body through battle, influenced by the Digital World's survival-of-the-fittest environment; however, no one knows the true extent of its abilities.

It has the courage to undauntedly face any difficulty. In battle, it will keep fighting without shutting down, unless it receives a certain amount of damage to its head. Its armor, referred to as \"Cyplasium Digizoid\", a super-metal with a self-repair feature through the use of nanomachines, allows it to fully recover from any damage sustained in combat before the next battle.

It is characterized by its large ears, and is able to fly through the air by using them as large wings, but because it only goes at a speed of 1 kph, it is said that it is definitely faster walking. However, it's very popular because its appearance is cute when it is desperately flying (though it seems that it doesn't feel the same). Due to its extremely obedient personality, its trainers are well-defended. Also, even though Patamon doesn't wear a Holy Ring, it is able to exhibit its hidden holy power, and it appears to have inherited the genes of ancient Digimon.",

Also, its wings have degenerated, and although it is unable to fly and its walking speed is slow, it is able to move with a speed of more than 60 kph by sliding across the ice on its belly.

It has a very gentle personality, and would usually let an enemy pass while keeping calm; it is a defensive Digimon through and through. However, it rarely ever goes on the offensive..",

        "description": "Rafflesimon is a Pixie Digimon. It is a Mega level Digimon said to be the largest flower in the Digital World. While its appearance is so beautiful that it enraptures all who lay eyes upon it, the stench it emits is out of this world. There are a number of people who fell for Rafflesimon's beauty at first sight and sought to find it again after a single glance. However, Rafflesimon's lifespan is short, and its life processes will cease after just several days have passed. Because of the extremely low likelihood of being able to catch sight of a Rafflesimon, it is also known as the \"Miraculous Flower\". Despite its circumstances, Rafflesimon never expresses any pessimism about its looming death, constantly yearning to live a normal life and dancing elegantly till its very last. It utilizes the large flower petals that dance around it as reflectors, reflecting its shots so that no enemy can escape.",

It is said to have been born when an evil being lurking in the depths of the Dark Area awakened, and the Digicores of the two Legend-Arms resonated with each other. Its main body, formed from the fusion of the Digicores at a higher plane, was made in the image of \"the knight that would wield them\" as imagined by Durandamon and Bryweludramon. While RagnaLoardmon is a DNA Digivolution form, it is unusual in that it still retains Durandamon and Bryweludramon's consciousnesses, while the main body itself has its own, separate consciousness. The sword and shield hover and move out of their own wills without coming into direct contact with RagnaLoardmon; they make sport of the enemy with the way they enact their offensive and defensive maneuvers like three separate beings in one body. Their level of coordination is stunning, giving rise to its absolute defense and sudden and unpredictable, yet powerful attacks, which are nigh impossible to overcome.",

It is an Android Digimon created from the sample data of an experiment that accelerated elementary particles to the speed of light with an accelerator. It is said that it was born from the fusion of that sample data, a Digimon raised for experimental use, and the Digi-Egg. As a very keen Digimon, it is able to accelerate to 98 percent of the speed of light, so there are no Digimon who can rival Rinkmon with their speed. However, because its power is weak in contrast to its outstanding speed, its fighting and hand-to-hand combat have a weak side to them.",

ShinMonzaemon is a moody Digimon with a childish personality that does not make decisions based in logic. It likes simple and cute things, causing it to target immature Digimon Rookie level and below. On the other hand, ShinMonzaemon considers Digimon that have grown beyond Rookie to be repulsive existences imbued with impure data, and despises even being close to them. When ShinMonzaemon feeds, it extends its soft wings to envelope its prey. Since its entire body is made of extremely powerful energy, even the softest touch from it is said to be enough to cause very weak Digimon to lose consciousness.",

It specializes in methods of concealing its appearance, freely uses ninjutsu to penetrate enemy territory, and can transmit the enemy info it has accumulated to its allies with Monitamon's \"Information Sharing\" ability, and is able to withdraw whenever it likes without being noticed...however, although it has this potential, for some mysterious and specific reason, it is never seen exhibiting this ability. Because its curiosity easily gets the best of it, it frequently sneaks into areas differing from its objective, and performs the wrong armed reconnaissance against its better judgment. In particular, there are many eyewitness reports of it at hot springs or pools. It insists that it is a \"scout\", not a \"voyeur\".",

        "description": "Shoutmonis a Small Dragon Digimon. It is a ferocious Digimon with extremely high aggressiveness due to its hot-blooded enthusiasm. However, it is friendly towards its comrades, and its friendship with other Digimon, surpassing species, can be deepened even further if they are recognized by Shoutmon. There is a unique feature to Shoutmon's singing that converts its passion to energy, and since Shoutmon won't give up fighting unless its passion disappears, this is the reason Shoutmon is said to be a ferocious Digimon with high aggressiveness. On one hand, it seems ferocious, but on the other, it is said to love music and songs, and it likes to hum songs with natural soundingbackground musiclike the sound of the wind, raindrops, the murmuring of a river, or the stirring of leaves on a tree. Because it can often become too enthusiastic in its song, accidentally letting off its \"Bellow Blaster\" (Soul Crusher) even though there aren't any enemies, it's probably safest to leave the spot at once if Shoutmon starts singing, so that it doesn't notice you. Shoutmon itself is said to have the mysterious trait of always having itsMcField-brand mic in its possession, and a Shoutmon without the mic is not really a Shoutmon. It is said that a Shoutmon that has completely lost its mic will rapidly lose power from the shock of not being a Shoutmon anymore, and before long, it will have wasted away. Therefore, you should never play a practical joke like hiding the mic. Incidentally, it can wield the mic as inb\u014djutsu, so it is excellent not only in scuffling matches but also in performances.",

Because Dorulumon must concentrate on charging the energy, the cooperation of Shoutmon to take charge of sighting is essential in order to hit the target. Furthermore, while charging the energy, Dorulumon's defensive power goes down to zero, leaving it completely defenseless.

The saw-shaped blade is strong and boasts peerless firmness, so that it shreds the opponent when it cuts through them, inflicting massive damage. Because the wounds are completely ragged, it takes time for the opponent to recover from the damage of an ordinary attack, and they incur even greater damage. Also, because the united Pickmon can shift freely, it possesses not only firmness, but also a flexibility that allows it to bend like a willow branch and absorb impacts that are too strong. It can be said that the Star Sword has an appearance which embodies the strong ties of Starmon and the Pickmons' emotional bond.",

Although it normally has a mild, kind, and friendly personality, once it gets into battle, it has a complete about-face to a warrior burning with fury. It becomes both cool and audacious enough for battles to get violent, and that appearance is fitting to the name of \"Crusade Mode\", as it seems to be one who acts as an agent of divine punishment.

It is a speedy knight who, if it wonders whether it can run across the land like a swift horse, will gallop to the heavens as if it was sprinting. Because Beelzemon's power has added to the power of Shoutmon X4, each of its techniques has been boosted exponentially.

It is the \"Weapons-fighter Mode\" (\u6b66\u53cc\u95d8\u58eb\u5f62\u614b, Busoutoushi Keitai), in which the Legend-Arm Spadamon became a powerful weapon and joined with Shoutmon X4, which incarnated from Shoutmon, Ballistamon, Dorulumon, and the Starmons. Spadamon trusts in the comrade that it accepted as its master and changed its shape. Shoutmon X4 has dramatically empowered its figure by equipping a weapon that, \"if held by an angel will save the world, and if held by a demon will destroy the world,\" so it races across the battlefield using a dual-wielding combat style in which it freely manipulates its two weapons to mow down its enemies and seize victory. The source of its power is its single-minded, passionate desire that it \"wants to defend someone,\" and it is a courageous fighter who demonstrates its maximum power when it fights to defend someone. Also, the firing of the vulcans on its head was sublimated into a Special Move due to Spadamon's power, so it has obtained an ability greater than being armed to compensate for the weakness of having both its hands occupied with weapons.",

Spadamon trusts in the comrade that it accepted as its master and changed its shape. Shoutmon X5 has empowered itself to transcendence by means of a weapon which conceals power that, \"if held by an angel will save the world, and if held by a demon will destroy the world.\" In particular, the flying ability possessed by Shoutmon X5 increased in power dramatically, obtaining tremendous propulsive power and endowing it with the supreme flying ability to fly out past the distant stratosphere and up to space. It also awakened to the ability to absorb cosmic energy directly into its body by advancing into space, and acquired the power to freely manipulate the absorbed energy as techniques of marvelous power. Here the cosmic-fighter filled with cosmic energy was born, soaring through space at hyper-speed.",

It is caring for Hackmon just like its elder sister, and also acts as its escort while accompanying Gankoomon on its journey. Although it is trying to diligently carry out Gankoomon's request and assist in training with Hackmon, it frequently ends up reining in its elder sister's violent manner. A long time ago, in its previous life, it was out on the streets with its elder sister Noir, but they were saved by Gankoomon just as they were going to collapse from exhaustion. In order to repay Gankoomon for saving it and its elder sister, it puts all of its effort into being a chaperone for Hackmon. It coordinates with Jesmon, Noir, and nearby Digimon to respond to the unusual phenomena and signs of chaos that occur all over the Digital World. The triple-pronged \"Cross Barb\u00e9e\" lance that it carries as a weapon has both an offensive side and a defensive side.",

It breaks the ice with its extremely cheerful personality and innocent behavior. It was charged with Hackmon's care by Gankoomon, and is training Hackmon while accompanying Gankoomon on its journey. However, Sistermon Noir is working half for training, half for fun, and will point its guns and laugh, even while admitting that Hackmon is sad. Its younger sister frequently ends up reining in its violent manner. A long time ago, in its previous life, it was out on the streets with its younger sister Blanc, but they were saved by Gankoomon just as they were going to collapse from exhaustion. It coordinates with Jesmon, Blanc, and nearby Digimon to respond to the unusual phenomena and signs of chaos that occur all over the Digital World. It carries guns called \"Anthony\" in its hands.",

However, if that bare DigiCore, thought to be its weak point, was struck, it would immediately be unable to maintain its vital functions.",

One of the legendary \"Legend-Arms\" who, according to legend, \"if held by an angel will save the world, and if held by a demon will destroy the world\", it is a Weapon Digimon that transforms itself into a weapon. Although its personality is earnest and serious, it has a side that is weak to pressure. Its combat abilities are low, but it shows its true merit once it becomes a weapon. It is the last, and the strongest, of the Legend-Arms in the LS-tou Zone. Since the LS-tou Zone kept being exposed to aggression from invaders, Spadamon was used as a trump card to pull them back from the edge of defeat, and it was released in a different Zone once its abilities were sealed along with its memories by its Legend-Arms comrades... it seems. Because its memories surrounding the seal have also vanished, it does not remember the exact details of where its memories are hidden and how to recover its abilities. After Spadamon escaped, the Zone was occupied by the invading army, and all of the Legend-Arms but Spadamon were defeated and went into stasis. Spadamon, who returned to the LS-tou Zone secretly, cannot currently remember how to recover its own true strength, but will fight against the invading force. Although its personality is to be earnest and serious, it is weak to pressure and ad-libbing due to its obsessive type. It is extremely fond of sweets, and has an obsessive level of belief in \"replenishing sugar for fatigue.\"",

        "description": "Sparrowmon is a Bird Digimon. It specializes in aerial battles and soars soundlessly at Mach speed. It is effective not only at speed but also at tight turns, and possesses the maneuverability to easily pull off a sudden turn. It is fundamentally someone that easily gets carried away due to its moodiness. Because the quality of its flying varies depending on how it feels at the moment, you can immediately tell whether its mood is good or bad, from whether it looks like it is flying well or badly. If it is performing highly difficult aerial acrobatics without even being asked, you can take it as being unmistakable proof that it is in high spirits. Sparrowmon's many extraordinary feats, too quick to catch with the eyes, are things that thoroughly capitalize on that maneuverability. The guns it holds in its hands are a set of twin pistols named \"Zanahoria\" (Esp: Carrot), made by Vulcanusmon, who produced their sister-gun, the \"Berenjena\" (Esp: Eggplant) possessed by Beelzemon.",

Furthermore, it possesses techniques that can cause abnormal conditions.",

There is definitely a strict hierarchy, and the complex maneuvers that are demanded by Starmon are demonstrated by the Pickmon, such as the corps techniques named \"Meteor Squall\" and \"Wish Upon A Star\". As Starmon has a cheerful, showy personality, it is an extreme optimist. Basically, it never gets depressed, and if it even seems depressed it seems to only be thinking things like, \"I may be down, but don't I look good?\" Because of that, even though it is taken lightly by other Digimon, it certainly doesn't worry about itself at all.",

Within the Sword of Storms is sealed a sinister power strong enough to split a star in two, so drawing this sword marks the collapse of a star. Therefore, Tactimon battles without drawing the sword, but even so, it exhibits the destructive force of its menace. The Sword of Storms, which conceals such tremendous power, is not a sword that just anyone can handle. From that alone can you understand the depth of Tactimon's true might. Even more than its merit as a soldier, it excels in strategy with plans which are even said to be, \"ingenuity itself, as if gushing forth like a spring,\" so Tactimon's true merit is not in physical strength but in ingenuity. When Tactimon leads an army, the outcome has already been decided, and it is said that, \"The victory has been decided before it even fought.\" Due to the various plans it has laid out, when Tactimon stands upon the battlefield it has already guaranteed its absolute advantage.",

As it is a machine-like Digimon that can only perform as commanded, it is absolutely incapable of spontaneous behavior. It doesn't get fatigued, it doesn't feel pain, it doesn't fear death, and it doesn't need to sleep. It is definitely a fighting machine. Its collective behavior is pretty basic, and its individual fighting strength is not very great, but that probably isn't able to make a dent in the extent of its confidence in its ability for human wave tactics, just due to its strength of numbers. An injured Troopmon will just exhale its energy filling, transferring it to a new special rubber body which is reborn as a new Troopmon, so it is actually sent out to the battlefield many times over.",

Disguising itself with the look of a fool to deceive the enemy's eyes, while surreptitiously drawing near its target and assassinating them, is Tuwarmon's special trait. The Punpun Armor drastically improves Tuwarmon's maneuverability by being split apart into boosters, so its movements have wind-like swiftness, too quick to catch with the eyes, and cannot be compared to their state before its abilities were released. Its two sickle-type \"Mantis Arm\" weapons are variously sickle-nunchaku tied with an electromagnetic chain, a long-handled polearm fused from the two, or a boomerang for throwing, and it switches between the variations freely as the situation demands.",

It has an artisan's pride and a stubborn personality. It sees through the competence of its clients, and when it feels that they can not master or will not treasure the weapon, it will deny the request. When building, it performs with a standard of work corresponding to the other party. As such, the Berenjena that it put all of its effort into after being charmed by Beelzemon's power is considered to be an excellent article, even by Vulcanusmon. Although it's a Digimon that freely manipulates its eight arms and works in silence, it exhibits an artisan's style even in battle.

While sleeping, Xiangpengmon's data keeps its environment at equilibrium. It will awaken if it senses a change for the worse in the waters, swiftly moving to fix the problem before returning to sleep. Because of its large size, any time it surfaces, wings flapping, it causes abnormal weather to occur. While it is in the sea, many other aquatic Digimon build nests in the crevices of its sleeping body. These Digimon give energy to Xiangpengmon so the latter can stay nourished while it sleeps, resulting a symbiotic relationship that helps all of them. None of Xiangpengmon's moves will harm singular targets. They are all large-scale attacks that cause widespread annihilation.",

This migratory bird inhabits cold lakes and rivers, traveling the Digital World in search of new habitats whenever currents are warm enough. Spotting Xiquemon flying around in search of a nest is considered a sign of fortune, and it is well known as a Digimon that brings good omens. Its dietary intake is low, so it has a habit of using a special move to freeze and save leftover food. Huankunmon's large body makes it an easy target, so it often mixes in with flocks of Xiquemon to travel around. When it moves, Huankunmon will surround the entire flock with a large bubble for protection. Since the bubble refracts light, the flock, including Huankunmon, will be invisible to the outside.",

According to one theory, when Millenniummon died in a furious battle, the dark soul it possessed was reborn as ZeedMillenniummon. Also, as for the bands of DigiCode which wrap around ZeedMillenniummon, it is said that they are like chains which suppress its abilities, but it is unknown who could cast such a spell on ZeedMillenniummon. However, it is foretold that if it is released from this spell, it will rain unfathomable destruction upon the Digital World.",

At a glance, it looks like a composed adult woman, but although it perplexes its opponents with its languid behavior, it actually has an impish personality that loves to capriciously embarrass people. It does things like purposefully telling its opponent unhappy fortunes or startling them. In battle, it seldom takes the initiative and helps out, but although you don't see its efforts, it will sometimes risk the possibility of getting into trouble. Once it feels so inclined, it glides freely through the sky, manipulating the wind and knocking out the opponent with a secret Mesopotamian spell.",

The will of the corps is at the discretion of Starmon, the Head of the corps, and the Head's decisions are briskly and unconditionally followed by the Pickmon, keeping them from falling out of line as they maneuver according to Starmon's directions. There is definitely a strict hierarchy, and the complex maneuvers that are demanded by Starmon are demonstrated by the Pickmon, such as the corps techniques named \"Meteor Squall\" and \"Wish Upon A Star\". As Starmon has a cheerful, showy personality, it is an extreme optimist. Basically, it never gets depressed, and if it even seems depressed it seems to only be thinking things like, \"I may be down, but don't I look good?\" Because of that, even though it is taken lightly by other Digimon, it certainly doesn't worry about itself at all.",
