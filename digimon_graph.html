It appears warlike at first glance, but because of its gentle personality, preferring harmony to conflict, it will never attack first. However, if it gets into a fight, it becomes a powerful and matchless fighter that swings its stout arms and wipes out the opponent. With its heavy armor and great power, its potential for both offense and defense is great, and if it connects with a hit then it doesn't quit, although its specialty is a one-hit knockout attack which capitalizes on its great power. However, its too-heavy body can be its ruin and there is a problem with its keenness, so it is not very good at fighting with fast-moving opponents. The horn on its head is its pride, and though the horn becomes the essence of its close-combat attacks, it hates for the horn to be carelessly touched. Also, Ballistamon is able to lend its heavy armor and power to another Digimon by changing into its \"Enhanced-armor Mode\"(å¼·åè£ç²å½¢æ,Kyoukasoukou Keitai).",

Within the Sword of Storms is sealed a sinister power strong enough to split a star in two, so drawing this sword marks the collapse of a star. Therefore, Tactimon battles without drawing the sword, but even so, it exhibits the destructive force of its menace. The Sword of Storms, which conceals such tremendous power, is not a sword that just anyone can handle. From that alone can you understand the depth of Tactimon's true might. Even more than its merit as a soldier, it excels in strategy with plans which are even said to be, \"ingenuity itself, as if gushing forth like a spring,\" so Tactimon's true merit is not in physical strength but in ingenuity. When Tactimon leads an army, the outcome has already been decided, and it is said that, \"The victory has been decided before it even fought.\" Due to the various plans it has laid out, when Tactimon stands upon the battlefield it has already guaranteed its absolute advantage.",

There is definitely a strict hierarchy, and the complex maneuvers that are demanded by Starmon are demonstrated by the Pickmon, such as the corps techniques named \"Meteor Squall\" and \"Wish Upon A Star\". As Starmon has a cheerful, showy personality, it is an extreme optimist. Basically, it never gets depressed, and if it even seems depressed it seems to only be thinking things like, \"I may be down, but don't I look good?\" Because of that, even though it is taken lightly by other Digimon, it certainly doesn't worry about itself at all.",
