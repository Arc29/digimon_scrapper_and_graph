It appears warlike at first glance, but because of its gentle personality, preferring harmony to conflict, it will never attack first. However, if it gets into a fight, it becomes a powerful and matchless fighter that swings its stout arms and wipes out the opponent. With its heavy armor and great power, its potential for both offense and defense is great, and if it connects with a hit then it doesn't quit, although its specialty is a one-hit knockout attack which capitalizes on its great power. However, its too-heavy body can be its ruin and there is a problem with its keenness, so it is not very good at fighting with fast-moving opponents. The horn on its head is its pride, and though the horn becomes the essence of its close-combat attacks, it hates for the horn to be carelessly touched. Also, Ballistamon is able to lend its heavy armor and power to another Digimon by changing into its \"Enhanced-armor Mode\"(強化装甲形態,Kyoukasoukou Keitai).",

It uses its \"Styx Killer\" claws, which have sharpened even more, in its quadrupedal and bipedal forms for a variety of things depending on the battle situation, and uses them skillfully not just for attacking, but also for things like slashing, piercing, sweeping and parrying as grappling weapons. Roaming near the entrance to hell, Cerberumon takes on assignments with ease. However, it is a cunning and ferocious hound who turns even its clients into prey for its claws without mercy when its rewards are not good enough.",

In addition, the claws on both its arms are scorched in the flames across its body and have become extremely hot, so the opponent that it has torn apart suffers double damage from being both lacerated and burned.",

It displays its especially tremendous fighting strength along with its sturdy flesh in close combat. Each of its techniques possesses immense destructive power, and furthermore, it can probably be said that it is almost impossible to hit Greymon in close combat because of its quick movements.

After Spadamon escaped, the Zone was occupied by the invading army, and all of the Legend-Arms but Spadamon were defeated and went into stasis. Spadamon, who returned to the LS-tou Zone secretly, cannot currently remember how to recover its own true strength, but will fight against the invading force. Although its personality is to be earnest and serious, it is weak to pressure and ad-libbing due to its obsessive type. It is extremely fond of sweets, and has an obsessive level of belief in \"replenishing sugar for fatigue.\"",

It is effective not only at speed but also at tight turns, and possesses the maneuverability to easily pull off a sudden turn. It is fundamentally someone that easily gets carried away due to its moodiness. Because the quality of its flying varies depending on how it feels at the moment, you can immediately tell whether its mood is good or bad, from whether it looks like it is flying well or badly. If it is performing highly difficult aerial acrobatics without even being asked, you can take it as being unmistakable proof that it is in high spirits. Sparrowmon's many extraordinary feats, too quick to catch with the eyes, are things that thoroughly capitalize on that maneuverability. The guns it holds in its hands are a set of twin pistols named \"Zanahoria\" (Esp: Carrot), made by Vulcanusmon, who produced their sister-gun, the \"Berenjena\" (Esp: Eggplant) possessed by Beelzemon.",

It is a ninja Digimon that released the heavy Punpun Armor (噴噴アーマー, Punpun Āmā, lit. \"Huffy Armor\") which was restraining its abilities and transformed to its true form from its temporary disguise, Damemon. Disguising itself with the look of a fool to deceive the enemy's eyes, while surreptitiously drawing near its target and assassinating them, is Tuwarmon's special trait. The Punpun Armor drastically improves Tuwarmon's maneuverability by being split apart into boosters, so its movements have wind-like swiftness, too quick to catch with the eyes, and cannot be compared to their state before its abilities were released. Its two sickle-type \"Mantis Arm\" weapons are variously sickle-nunchaku tied with an electromagnetic chain, a long-handled polearm fused from the two, or a boomerang for throwing, and it switches between the variations freely as the situation demands.",

This migratory bird inhabits cold lakes and rivers, traveling the Digital World in search of new habitats whenever currents are warm enough. Spotting Xiquemon flying around in search of a nest is considered a sign of fortune, and it is well known as a Digimon that brings good omens. Its dietary intake is low, so it has a habit of using a special move to freeze and save leftover food. Huankunmon's large body makes it an easy target, so it often mixes in with flocks of Xiquemon to travel around.
