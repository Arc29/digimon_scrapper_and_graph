As for the flower on its head, when it is joyful or happy, it will waft about a sweet fragrance, but when it is angered or senses danger, it releases a foul stench that will drive off even large Digimon. The aroma emitted from the flower on its head is definitely inherited from Palmon, so as usual, it is intensely foul.",

Next, a different opponent, with its Stick, it beats. The first one, it beats. The next again, it beats. Then a third, it beats. Despite pretending to beat, it beats. No matter how, it beats. With this beating and beating and beating, a rhythm will gradually be produced. Sometimes harshly and sometimes dolefully, DonShoutmon will battle while spinning a tune.

When Magnamon's muscles, or 'Chrome Digizoid', are strained, they temporarily transform into \"Gold Digizoid\", which envelops its entire body in a golden glow; not only does it raise physical defense, it also bestows a state of absolute defense that is capable of resisting even data-disintegrating types of attacks. Furthermore, when in the \"Gold Digizoid\" state, its properties are similar to those of the Huanglong Ore, which boasts unparalleled, absolute hardness and is used as the base for 'Chrome Digizoid'; as such, in addition to absolute defense, it also adds a great amount of weight ill-suited for Digimon, though Magnamon has overcome that by tempering its own 'Chrome Digizoid'.

A collection of the four energies of fire, earth, wind and water, it lacks actual substance except for its Digicore. Despite being visible, it cannot be touched; only those who have been recognized by Mitamamon itself or Digimon who are on the verge of death are allowed to touch it. However, those who have figured out where Mitamamon's Digicore is can also touch it, so there are occasions when it is challenged to battle by extremely rare yet rough-tempered Digimon. Because Mitamamon has a calm personality and despises conflict, it often ignores battles it has been challenged to. However, as for those who have incurred its wrath once, Mitamamon changes into a raging beast that deals a crushing blow to them without mercy.",

However, it's very popular because its appearance is cute when it is desperately flying (though it seems that it doesn't feel the same). Due to its extremely obedient personality, its trainers are well-defended. Also, even though Patamon doesn't wear a Holy Ring, it is able to exhibit its hidden holy power, and it appears to have inherited the genes of ancient Digimon.",

It is the last, and the strongest, of the Legend-Arms in the LS-tou Zone. Since the LS-tou Zone kept being exposed to aggression from invaders, Spadamon was used as a trump card to pull them back from the edge of defeat, and it was released in a different Zone once its abilities were sealed along with its memories by its Legend-Arms comrades... it seems. Because its memories surrounding the seal have also vanished, it does not remember the exact details of where its memories are hidden and how to recover its abilities. After Spadamon escaped, the Zone was occupied by the invading army, and all of the Legend-Arms but Spadamon were defeated and went into stasis. Spadamon, who returned to the LS-tou Zone secretly, cannot currently remember how to recover its own true strength, but will fight against the invading force. Although its personality is to be earnest and serious, it is weak to pressure and ad-libbing due to its obsessive type. It is extremely fond of sweets, and has an obsessive level of belief in \"replenishing sugar for fatigue.\"",

It is effective not only at speed but also at tight turns, and possesses the maneuverability to easily pull off a sudden turn. It is fundamentally someone that easily gets carried away due to its moodiness. Because the quality of its flying varies depending on how it feels at the moment, you can immediately tell whether its mood is good or bad, from whether it looks like it is flying well or badly. If it is performing highly difficult aerial acrobatics without even being asked, you can take it as being unmistakable proof that it is in high spirits. Sparrowmon's many extraordinary feats, too quick to catch with the eyes, are things that thoroughly capitalize on that maneuverability. The guns it holds in its hands are a set of twin pistols named \"Zanahoria\" (Esp: Carrot), made by Vulcanusmon, who produced their sister-gun, the \"Berenjena\" (Esp: Eggplant) possessed by Beelzemon.",

Even more than its merit as a soldier, it excels in strategy with plans which are even said to be, \"ingenuity itself, as if gushing forth like a spring,\" so Tactimon's true merit is not in physical strength but in ingenuity.

This migratory bird inhabits cold lakes and rivers, traveling the Digital World in search of new habitats whenever currents are warm enough. Spotting Xiquemon flying around in search of a nest is considered a sign of fortune, and it is well known as a Digimon that brings good omens. Its dietary intake is low, so it has a habit of using a special move to freeze and save leftover food. Huankunmon's large body makes it an easy target, so it often mixes in with flocks of Xiquemon to travel around. When it moves, Huankunmon will surround the entire flock with a large bubble for protection. Since the bubble refracts light, the flock, including Huankunmon, will be invisible to the outside.",

The will of the corps is at the discretion of Starmon, the Head of the corps, and the Head's decisions are briskly and unconditionally followed by the Pickmon, keeping them from falling out of line as they maneuver according to Starmon's directions. There is definitely a strict hierarchy, and the complex maneuvers that are demanded by Starmon are demonstrated by the Pickmon, such as the corps techniques named \"Meteor Squall\" and \"Wish Upon A Star\". As Starmon has a cheerful, showy personality, it is an extreme optimist. Basically, it never gets depressed, and if it even seems depressed it seems to only be thinking things like, \"I may be down, but don't I look good?\" Because of that, even though it is taken lightly by other Digimon, it certainly doesn't worry about itself at all.",
